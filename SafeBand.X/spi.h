/* SPI Interface for MMC
 *
 * This is an SPI interface intended to be the back-end for the MMC component.
 * It is not a generic SPI implementation. To create such an implementation
 * is beyond the scope of M-Stack. Further, a generic implementation of SPI
 * would require more code space than would be acceptable on some of the
 * smaller supported microcontrollers (namely the 8-bit PICs).
 *
 * Thus, this implementation really only exists to serve the supported boards
 * in their specific configurations. However, modification for a custom board
 * should be easy and straight forward.
 *
 * This SPI interface is configured from board.h, which contains definitions
 * specific to the supported boards.
